## Test Task

You are developing a new dashboard. Your task is to create a new dashboard with which the user can manage his account. Of course, it is not supposed to be complete. We would like to limit ourselves to just one excerpt.

In this scenario, the form used to modify the user profile information has to be created. The form contains two tabs, as specified below and shown in the mockup.

The user wants to be able to switch between the two tabs and to enter the following information:

In the first tab (basic data):

Change e-mail address
Change Password
The password must have certain properties:
"Password" and "Password repeat" fields need to be identical (including an indicator for this equality)
The password field should accept Uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters
A multi-color password strength indicator should be implemented
Button to update the user data
In the second tab (Address):

Change first name
Change Last Name
Change address (street, house number, postal code)
Change country (Germany, Austria, Switzerland are available)
Button to update the user data
The form also needs a button to submit the information through a fake AJAX call.

It is important that the user receives feedback if his input is incorrect, correct, his data has not been saved and his data has been successfully saved.

The layout also contains a header and a sidebar, which are not functioning in this test.
